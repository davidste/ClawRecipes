# Verify built-in team recipes (scaffold + cron jobs)

This checklist verifies that each built-in **team** recipe scaffolds correctly and that any recipe-defined cron jobs reconcile safely.

## Prereqs
- You have OpenClaw installed and `openclaw` is on PATH.
- Set recipes cron installation behavior in config (safe default is `prompt`).
  - `cronInstallation: prompt` ⇒ asks before installing cron jobs
  - `cronInstallation: on` ⇒ installs cron jobs (enabled state still depends on `enabledByDefault`)
  - `cronInstallation: off` ⇒ skips cron reconciliation

## Teams to verify
- product-team
- research-team
- writing-team
- social-team
- customer-support-team
- development-team

## Commands

### Scaffold each team

> Note: `--team-id` must end with `-team`.

For each recipe id `<rid>` above:

```bash
openclaw recipes scaffold-team <rid> --team-id <rid>-team --apply-config
```

### Verify scaffold output

For each `~/.openclaw/workspace-<rid>-team/` ensure:
- `notes/plan.md` exists
- `notes/status.md` exists
- `shared-context/priorities.md` exists
- `shared-context/agent-outputs/` exists
- `work/backlog/`, `work/in-progress/`, `work/testing/`, `work/done/` exist

### Verify cron reconciliation behavior

1) With `cronInstallation: prompt`:
   - Re-run scaffold-team and confirm you are prompted.
   - Answer **No** and verify that installed jobs are created **disabled** (or not created, depending on implementation).

2) With `cronInstallation: on`:
   - Re-run scaffold-team and verify recipe cron jobs are installed.

3) Confirm jobs are listed:

```bash
openclaw cron list
```

4) Optionally force-run a job:

```bash
openclaw cron run <jobId>
```

## What to record
- Any recipe that fails to scaffold
- Any cron job install/update errors
- Any cron job that runs but fails (include logs / error output)
